## Welcome to Soggies!
Soggies is a software design and development project from the final of my web development course. Completed in approximately 3 days, Soggies includes:
- PHP backend to validate form input and keep data secure
- MySQL database for product information, customer data, and tracking sales
- XML / AJAX calls for real-time cart updates and username availability
- Dynamic page element creation (enabled with PHP, sourced from my database)
- Intuitive and generally appealing UI / UX

### Future implementations? Improvements?
- Connection with payment processing systems
- Emailing system for blogs, sales, and premium codes
- Input menu for suggestions, breed requests, etc
- Blog page, info pages for each breed sold
